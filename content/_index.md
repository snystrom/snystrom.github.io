I am a Molecular Biologist turned Data Scientist and Software Engineer, passionate about building high-quality data stacks and user-friendly performant software. 

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href=https://getrecast.com/>Recast</a>.

I did my PhD in Genetics & Molecular Biology at UNC where I wrote a lot of code and did a lot of pipetting. 

Now I write even more code and do no pipetting.
